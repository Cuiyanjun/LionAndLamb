# Lion and Lamb
This is the source code for the free **Lion and Lamb - Admiring Jesus Christ** iOS 8 app. It can be compiled with Xcode 6.4+ and it uses ARC.

This app creates word clouds using the most frequent words from a chosen book of the Bible.  The larger the word appears in the cloud, the more often it occurs in the Bible.
